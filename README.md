# fMRI Data Organization, Manipulation, and Analysis

This repo contains a collection of scripts (Bash and Python) used during my PhD to organize, manipulate, and analyze neuroimaging data. These scripts are intended to be used on our group's remote Linux server, but can be easily translated to other machines and purposes. Each script can operate independently and are not intrinsically linked as a pipeline.

## Installation

Necessary modules required for a given script will be listed in the script's header.

## Usage

Specific purpose of script will be provided in the name and expanded upon in the script's header.

## Contributing

Primary author of scripts is myself - Noah Waller. Scripts will be updated as iterations come around.
