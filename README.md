# fMRI Data Organization, Manipulation, and Analysis

This repo contains a collection of scripts (Bash, Python, and R) used during my PhD to organize, manipulate, and analyze neuroimaging data. These scripts are intended to be used on our group's remote Linux server, but can be easily translated to other machines and purposes. Each script can operate independently and are not intrinsically linked as a pipeline. Individual date of creation for each script does NOT correspond with date committed to this repo - generally, the range of script creation dates is from Jan. 2021 - present.

## Installation

Necessary modules required for a given script will be listed in the script's header.

## Usage

Specific purpose of script will be provided in the name and expanded upon in the script's header.

## Contributing

Primary author of scripts is myself - Noah Waller. Scripts will be updated as iterations come around.
